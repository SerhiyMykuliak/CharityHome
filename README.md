This project was created by Serhij Mikuliak for practices at the University of Oil and Gas.

This project is a donation web application where users can donate to charity, view posts and send emails to the admin.

In turn, admins can create, update, delete new causes and posts, they can also add new volunteers to the group and add new photos to the gallery
